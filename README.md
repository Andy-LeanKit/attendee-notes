# WHAT

A consolidated repository where all attendees of the WriteTheDocs NA 2015 conference are welcome to contribute their notes for each presentation. After the conference ends, we will collaborate to make a "master file" of all the best notes.

# WHO

Everyone is welcome to contribute! Fork the repo to upload your notes under your GitHub username, and when done make a PR!

Organized by @alexfornuto

# WHERE

We're currently (Sunday) at the first table downstairs in the CENTRL office.

# WHY

Last year a number of WriteTheDocs attendees put their notes in git repositories on their GitHub accounts. By placing everyones' impressions of the talks in one place, we can all benefit from each other's understandings!

# HOW

The directory structure is broken down by day, and then by talk. Each talk's folder contains a readme file with a synopsis of the talk.

To add your notes, first create a fork of the repo. Create a file in that folder as $githubusername.md and add your notes (preferable in Markdown or GitHub Flavored Markdown). At the end, create a pull request of your fork to the main fork.

You can easily do this all via the GitHub UI. To create a new file in a fork of the project, click the + sign next to the repo name. On the next page, you'll be able to name your file and add your notes to it. You can create a pull request by clicking the green button to the left of the branch listing and repo name.

After the conference ends, we as a community can work on a master notes file for each directory, pulling the best from each submission.

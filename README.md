# WHAT

A consolidated repository where all attendees of the WriteTheDocs NA 2015 conference are welcome to contribute their notes for each presentation. After the conference ends, we will collaborate to make a "master file" of all the best notes.

# WHO

Everyone is welcome to contribute! Fork the repo to upload your notes under your GitHub username, and when done make a PR!

Organized by @alexfornuto

# WHERE

We're currently (Sunday) at the first table downstairs in the CENTRL office.

# WHY

Last year a number of WriteTheDocs attendees put their notes on GitHub. By placing everyones' impressions of the talks in one place, we can all benefit from each other's understandings!

# HOW

Make a fork of the repo. The directory structure is broken down by day, and then by talk. Each talk's folder contains a readme file with a synopsis of the talk. Create a file in that folder as $githubusername.md and add your notes (preferable in Markdown or GitHub Flavored Markdown). At the end, create a pull request of your branch to the main fork.

After the conference ends, we as a community can work on a master notes file for each directory, pulling the best from each submission.

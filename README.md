# WHAT

A consolidated repository where all attendees of the WriteTheDocs NA 2015 conference are welcome to contribute their notes for each presentation. After the conference ends, we can collaborate to make a "master file" of all the best notes.

# WHO

Everyone is welcome to contribute! @alexfornuto is organizing.

# WHERE

We're currently at the first table downstairs in the CENTRL office.

# WHY

Last year I was one of at least three people putting their notes up on GitHub, and I thought it would be of greater benifit to everyone interested to find everyone's impressions of the talks all in one place.

# HOW

Make a fork of the repo, and create your own branch with your name or other identifier. At the end create a pull request of your branch to the main fork.

The directory structure is broken down by day, and then by talk. Each talk's folder contains a readme file with a synopsis of the talk. Create a file in that folder as $githubusername.md and add your notes (preferable in Markdown or GitHub Flavored Markdown).

After the conference ends, we as a community can work on a master notes file for each directory, pulling the best from each submission.

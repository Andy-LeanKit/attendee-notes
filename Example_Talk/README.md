# Example Talk

This is an example talk that will not take place.  We are using this to demonstrate what a directory for a talk might look like after merging contributer notes.

To add your notes to a talk directory:

1. Fork the GitHub repository.
2. Create a new branch (a single branch can be used for all of your changes).
3. Create your notes in the associated talk directory as a separate `.md` file with an identifiable name.
4. Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
5. Make a pull request on the main repo to have your notes merged.

Once everyone's notes are collected, we will begin a process of compiling a master notes page for each talk from the individual contributions.

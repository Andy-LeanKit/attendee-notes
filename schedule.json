As tech writers, we often spend a lot of time talking about the overall shape of the forest and the variety of paths within it (conceptual docs), creating detailed catalogs of local tree species (reference docs), and providing step-by-step guides to things like \u201chow to cross a river\u201d or \u201chow to knock on a door\u201d (task-based docs).<br>\nBut none of that helps your customers when they just want to know how to get to Grandmother\u2019s house, without getting lost in the forest, falling into the river, and accidentally going to the other cabin in the woods, where the lycanthropic senior citizens live.<br>\nIn other words, your customers need a narrative. And maybe they need lots of them. When you\u2019re dealing with products that can be run and configured in a bewildering variety of ways, a single getting started manual might not do the trick. It\u2019s like giving people a Choose Your Own Adventure book and only allowing them to choose one path through to the end.<br>\nFor my talk I\u2019ll explain how we became aware of the need for better scenario-based documentation, and how we ended up building a prototype during a hack week project. Now we\u2019re on our way to creating a collection of short stories that show users how to string sets of features and procedures together to solve complex problems. We\u2019ll cover some of the things we\u2019ve learned along the way and offer best practices for those who want to tell a few stories of their own.<br>\nMatt Ness is a technical writer with over twenty years of experience at places like PeopleSoft, Oracle, and Intuit.

It begins with a statement of the desired result and any assumptions that must be made. It guides the reader through a set of logical sequential steps, supported by figures to aid intuition or cross-references for prerequisite knowledge. It ends by declaring that the desired result has been achieved. At risk of insulting every mathematician who ever lived, in many ways a proof is not so different from a grand, abstract how-to document.<br>\nPerhaps surprisingly, for most of human history mathematical proofs and mathematics itself have been written in prose. Even those of us who cringe at the memory of high school algebra can agree that \u201c10x + y^2 = 3\u201d is more user-friendly than \u201cthe sum of an unknown quality multiplied by ten and another unknown quantity multiplied by itself is equal to three\u201d. The first part of this talk explores the development of mathematical writing, which can be divided into improvements in symbolic representation and improvements in structure. This discussion is partly inspired by Bret Victor\u2019s observation that the most influential breakthroughs in the history of mathematics were actually breakthroughs in \u201cUI design\u201d, for example the invention of arabic numerals (0, 1, 2, 3,...) as a replacement for clunky roman numerals (I, II, III, IV\u2026).<br>\nProofs and rigorous documentation empower their readers to greater understanding by never relying on authority or persuasion. A mathematical proof, unlike a scientific experiment or a souffle recipe, must show that the desired result is always achieved when the right steps are executed under the right conditions. Users of computer applications certainly expect documentation to live up to the same standards. The second part of this talk explores the concept of mathematical proof in more depth. We will look at how proofs are structured and use logic in a particular way to minimize ambiguity and maximize credibility, and how the writing process is itself a powerful tool to root out hidden assumptions and errors in thinking.</p>"

It described in excruciating detail every option available on the UI, but didn&#39;t told our users how they could actually find what they needed!<br>\nFor us it was a nightmare to maintain the docs. Our development environment was constantly changing and we couldn&#39;t keep up with the changes.<br>\nMore importantly, we weren&#39;t meeting the user needs.

For instance, the doc page for the find text feature was called &quot;Find Tool&quot;.

Design by default is not a good strategy!<br>\nThis talk discusses how:<br>\nInformation inherently includes design, whether or not you meant to do it. Information also requires design, no matter how simple and straightforward it may seem.<br>\nTechnical information can be roughly sorted into modes such as descriptive, defensive, procedural, and tutorial. (These are different from concept-task-reference.)<br>\nEach of these modes has different design implications that address different audiences and needs.<br>\nBeing aware of your design priorities can help you understand how to make your stakeholders happier as your documentation base grows with the organization.</p>"

What\u2019s a tech writer to do!?<br>\nIn true agile fashion, the response to these challenges varies across products and writers within Atlassian. This gives us a breadth of stories and examples I can share about our experiences in this world. Here\u2019s a high-level look at what I\u2019ll share:<br>\nA brief discussion of continuous deployment: what does it mean, especially for tech writers and others involved in the process?<br>\nA look at some things that have worked for us. Making the mental shift from releases to features has been an absolute necessity. We\u2019ve also had to change the tooling we use, the processes we follow, and the way we communicate. This journey has also forced us to consider what the documentation equivalent of an MVP (minimal viable product in Agile development) looks like.<br>\nThere are a few things that haven\u2019t worked out very well! Resource-heavy deliverables (like videos and tutorials) are really difficult to maintain. Communication also increases in importance in a rapidly-paced cycle. These and other areas provide us with some good lessons learned.<br>\nThe jury is still out on a few experiments! Things like investing more heavily in in-app help and automating doc publication in tandem with code deployment are among the experiments we\u2019re attempting to get better at this new world.</p>"

However, we are often asked (or voluntold) by our organizations to wear other hats beyond our primary writing duties: repair and build relationships, analyze business processes, learn about how others react to change, discover unknown troves of documentation, train and encourage the next generation of writers, gather and crunch data, tell stories, design workflows, and perform \u201cother duties as needed.\u201d Some may respond with an exasperated \u201cI wasn\u2019t trained on this!!!\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s not part of my job!\u201d But those of us who embrace the opportunity to stretch beyond our areas of expertise and learn new peripheral skills may realize that working on a documentation equivalent of a cleaning up Superfund site can turn into super fun.<br>\nIn this talk, I will share my experiences and lessons learned as a technical writer who is witnessing this documentation culture change, one conversation at a time.

We talk a lot about failure, and how to learn from it and not replicate failures over and over again. But what I haven\u2019t heard a lot of discussion about is how we know we\u2019ve succeeded. Is it market share? Usable product? Could understanding and setting a measurable, achievable goals help us overcome imposter syndrome, second sock syndrome, and feature creep?<br>\nThis talk provides some metrics on identifying success, documenting what it will look like when you get there, preserving the idea, and dealing with the inevitable distractions and changes in direction that may prevent you from ending up where you expect.<br>\nI plan to speak on how documentation can serve a crucial function at both defining and driving success. We need to stop believing that agile is the end of the answer and embrace it as part of building what we want to have in the end.<br>\nContinuous improvement can have a victory condition, if we build it.</p>"
